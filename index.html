<p>Telegram Messenger is a globally accessible freemium, cross-platform, encrypted, cloud-based and centralized instant messaging (IM) service. The application also provides optional end-to-end encrypted chats, popularly known as secret chat and video calling,[10] VoIP, file sharing and several other features. It was launched for iOS on 14 August 2013 and Android on 20 October 2013. The servers of Telegram are distributed worldwide with five data centers in different parts of the world, while the operational center is based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.[11][12][13][14] Various client apps are available for desktop and mobile platforms including official apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux (although registration requires an iOS or Android device and a working phone number).[15][16][17] There are also two official Telegram web twin apps, WebK and WebZ,[18] and numerous unofficial clients that make use of Telegram's protocol. Telegram's official components are open source,[19] with the exception of the server which is closed-sourced and proprietary</p>
